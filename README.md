# xiao_codec
Audio codec shield for the Seeed xiao-ble (https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/XIAO_BLE/).
The audio codec is a AIC3254 (https://www.ti.com/product/TLV320AIC3254).

# audio IO
The shield has header pins that directly connects to the audio IO pins of the codec. For connecting to headphones or analog microphones see the application note of the codec (https://www.ti.com/lit/ug/slau497a/slau497a.pdf?ts=1724654493899&ref_url=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.google.com%252F). I.e. if you want to drive headphones, place series capacitors (47u) on the headphone pins to remove the DC.
